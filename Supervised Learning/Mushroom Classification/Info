In this Mushroom Classification project I performed binary classification to label mushrooms as being edible or poisonous, starting from a wide range of mushroom atributes.

The UCI Dataset for Mushroom Classification is retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification/data

For correlation and classification the Python Scikit Learn package is used.

The dataset consists of attributes that are categorical, discrete and nominal. Therefore the possible features are One Hot Encoded before feeding them to different classifiers. 
Correlation with the target label is analysed with Pearson's coefficient and bar plots. Despite some clear correlations I decide to work with all columns and keep all features for classification.

For the classification I tried KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree and Naive Bayes.

All classifiers gave very high results of accuracy, precision and recall. Best results are obtained with KNN and Logistic Regression. Decision Tree and SVM gave very good results depending on parameters. The Naive Bayes classifier gave "worst" results.
